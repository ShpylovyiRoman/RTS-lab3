## Usage
<H4>3.1
 After entering our number and clicking on the button, we see that our algorithm has successfully worked:

<H4>3.2
 For the perceptron, we need to enter the number of iterations, the max time and the education speed, after pressing the button, we see the result:

<H4>3.3
 To generate populations in a genetic algorithm, we need more information. If we enter all the necessary starting data we can start our algorithm.
  <br/>Also, by running our algorithm several times with the same input data, we can confirm that it works correctly:
